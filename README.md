Ipython notebook outlining how kmeans works, and with a second ipython notebook that requires the user to fill in the algorithm to calculate the distance between each point and each cluster center, using pythagoras' theorem.



## Instructions:


```
git clone https://github.com/amlwwalker/kmeans-ipython.git
cd kmeans-ipython
source setup
```
(open `model.ipynb` for teacher, and `exercise.ipynb` for students)
